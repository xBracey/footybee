    `FootyBee is a World Cup 2022/21 football predictor. As a FootyBee user, you can make predictions on games, create and
        join leagues with your friends and compete in our global FootyBee leaderboard. You score points by making correct
        predictions about match results, teams qualifying for each round and predictions.`,

    `FootyBee is built using React as a frontend, Redux as a data layer, a combination of NextJS and ExpressJS for the backend and 
        Sequelize as an ORM between the API and the database. The FootyBee app is built using a combination of mostly React Native and Redux.`,

  howHeader: `How it came about.`,
  howParagraphs: [
    `The idea of creating a football predictor for the Euros started 4 years ago by my brother, James. He created a mini league between me and 10
        of his mates and each of us made predictions and each match result and which teams would qualify for each round after the group stage.
        Each player got points for correct predictions and we each chipped in a tenner for a prize pool to make things more interesting.`,

    `2 years later, we did the same for the World Cup. Since I was a newly graduated computer science student I decided to try 
        making a website to manage the entire process. As I learned while developing the website, I sorely misjudged how long it would take 
        and the website was half finished, look very basic and only lasted for the group stages!`,

    `3 more years later and I have a much better grasp of developing website and have some app development experience. 
        As someone who likes a challenge, I decided to expand the original idea which first spawned 4 years ago, 
        and create a web app where multiple leagues can be hosted on a single site with more flexibility in how points in leagues are distributed. 
        Which bring us to this website which is built entirely from scratch and hopefully much better than my last attempt.`,
